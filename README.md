This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the customer retention in a bank. The features included individual credit score,age,account balance and also whether one is an active member. I performed ETL processes and dropped columns that were not relevant to the analysis. I encoded categorical features to continious variables. I used different machine learning alogarithims  and found the most suitable one was the random forest classifier. To boost model performance i performed grid search on the model to get the best model and parameters where i fitted them back to the training data. I performed test accuracy with the selected features and the model performance was at about 87%
