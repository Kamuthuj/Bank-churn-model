This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the customer retention in a bank. The features included individual credit score,age,account balance and also whether one is an active member. I performed ETL processes and dropped columns that were not relevant to the analysis. I encoded categorical features to continious variables. I used different machine learning alogarithims which scored differently in their performances. I opted for the random forest classifier which relatively performed better than the others. I performed grid search to further get the best parameters for the model, and retrained it using the new parameters. I also encompassed recursive feature elimination with cross validation(RFECV) to get the selected features for the model. I performed test accuracy on this selected features and scored an accuracy score of 0.842. I converted this features into a list where i saved the model. I created a streamlit app to predict customer retention on unseen data using the selected features.
